# Hi, I'm Maria Boxwala :)

**Magna Cum Laude in Computer Engineering | ML Engineer | NLP, Remote Sensing, CV**

Iâ€™m a freshly graduated machine learning enthusiast with a curiosity-fueled drive to build models that make a real-world impact. My work spans efficient natural language processing, computer vision, and remote sensing, with a special focus on building **low-latency**, **resource-efficient** ML systems.

## About Me

At the **American University of Sharjah**, I graduated **Magna Cum Laude** and led top honors societies like **IEEE-HKN** (President) and **Tau Beta Pi** (Vice President). My academic and personal projects reflect both breadth and depthâ€”ranging from **Arabic poetry generation with LLMs** to **satellite-based biodiversity assessment**.

I'm deeply invested in:
-  **Multilingual NLP** for social good
- **Remote sensing** and ecological AI
- **Edge-efficient AI** and inference optimization

## Recent Projects

**Arabic LLMs for Poetry**
Fine-tuned and benchmarked models like **AraGPT-2**, **AraT5**, and **Jais** for structure-aware Arabic poetry generation. Used metrics like Self-BLEU and perplexity, and explored LoRA-tuned and diffusion-based models.

**Biodiversity from Space**  
Built a CNN-based predictor using **satellite imagery + camera-trap data** to estimate species richness in desert biomes. Supported by **WWF and KAUST**.

**Cross-Lingual Sentiment Bridge**  
Engineered a novel chained multilingual bridge using **FastText**, **Lang2Vec**, and **pseudo-inverse transforms** to align distant languages and improve sentiment classification on Arabic social-media text.
